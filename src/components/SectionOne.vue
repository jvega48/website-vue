                                        I am Computer Science student at California State University, Los Angeles.
                                        I am a senior working on my senior project implementing a virtual assistant using artificial intelligence.
                                        I grew up in the City of Angels surrounded by beautiful art and the flavorful variety of food.
                                        I grew up with a huge interest for the tech industry.
                                        I started of by exploring the computer components and reassembling them together.
                                        After I graduated from high school I went directly to college and I had a clear understanding of the career path I wanted to pursue.
                                    </p> 
									<p> I decided to enrolled in the Computer Science department at my local college. At the time, I was attending the Los Angeles Southwest College.
                                        Then a few years later I was more involved in the software aspect of the computer.
                                        I remember the first time I wrote my first program in BASIC. It was quite an exciting moment because I felt a big accomplishment.
                                        This feeling kept me going until I took other programming classes like C++, Java, and HTML to name a few.
                                        I have linked my resume to read more about my experience, education, and skills.
